=# Hi, I'm Murad Ali 👋

I build reliable software for search, speech and document understanding. I focus on turning unstructured files like invoices and PDFs into clean, usable data and on shipping services that are fast, stable and easy to observe.

## What I work on
- Document and invoice data extraction with OCR and layout aware models
- Practical retrieval and grounding for question answering
- Speech pipelines with accurate transcription on real world audio
- Production systems with clear APIs, metrics and alerts

## Impact
- Clinical assistant pilots cut lookup time from minutes to seconds and reduced post visit documentation by about 25 to 35 percent
- Speech models improved word error rate by 6 to 8 points while keeping real time behavior stable
- Invoice extraction reached over 90 percent F1 on key fields and lowered manual review
- Serving got about 30 percent faster at the median by using lower precision models and streaming tokens

## Selected projects
- Shift scheduling assistant that generates conflict free plans and respects real constraints
- Multi agent automation that files and routes work, posts updates to chat and looks up fixes from a knowledge base
- Early dyslexia screening that combines handwriting analysis and speech features
- Invoice processing pipeline that converts scans into line items with validation and confidence checks
- Clinical consultation helper that surfaces grounded answers and scrubs sensitive data

## Tools I use
- Python and C++
- FastAPI
- FAISS and pgvector
- Whisper and Wav2Vec2
- Tesseract, DocTR, LayoutLMv3 and Donut
- vLLM and Docker
- GCP and Vertex AI
- PostgreSQL
- Git and simple CI
- Dashboards and tracing

## How I work
I like readable code, small interfaces and measurable results. I ship in small steps, watch the graphs and iterate. Open to collaboration and feedback. Issues and PRs are welcome.
